# pexecute
A script to execute stuff in ITerm2 Panels.

Running pexecute will create a new Panel, which will execute the command specified by the arguments, and close the pane when the command exits.


`pexecute ssh 8.8.8.8` will create an ssh tunnel in a new panel, and close the panel when you close the tunnel.
